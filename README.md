Aim:

To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).

Algorithm:
1. Identify user pain points.

Write 1–2 clear UX problem statements using the defined template:

"[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods

Identify the most suitable research methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing, diary studies).

Justify your method choice.

3. Creating Personas

Based on previous user data or a given user scenario.

4. Create at least two user personas with:

Demographics

Goals

Behaviors

Pain points

Motivation

##  OUTPUT


Project Scenario 1: Government Service Portal (Online Citizen Services)
1. Problem Statements
User Pain Points

Citizens face difficulty in finding the correct government forms or applying for services online. The portal interface is outdated, extremely text-heavy, and often confusing—especially for first-time users.

Problem Statement 1

“Citizens need a way to easily locate and apply for government services because the current portals have complex navigation and unclear categories, which results in user confusion and incomplete applications.”

Problem Statement 2

“Elderly users need a way to access essential services without technical difficulty because most portals are not mobile-friendly, which results in frustration and reliance on others for help.”


2. Research Methods
Chosen Methods

User Interviews:
To understand challenges faced by people of different age groups using government portals.

Heuristic Evaluation:
To find usability and accessibility issues such as poor visibility, inconsistent categories, missing instructions, and unclear error messages.

Justification

Interviews help gather real frustrations and expectations.
Heuristic evaluation helps identify UI problems like cluttered text, inconsistent navigation, lack of guidance, and poor mobile responsiveness.

3. User Personas
Persona 1: Meena Iyer

Age: 52

Occupation: School Teacher

Motivation: Wants quick and reliable access to online forms and status tracking.


Project Scenario 2: Food Delivery App (QuickMeal)
1. Problem Statements
User Pain Points

Users get confused by too many restaurant choices, cluttered menu items, and repeated offers. The checkout process is long and filled with unnecessary steps.

Problem Statement 1

“Busy professionals need a way to order food quickly because too many restaurant and menu options make decision-making difficult, which results in order delays and app abandonment.”

Problem Statement 2

“Frequent users need a simplified checkout process because extra confirmation steps slow down the ordering experience, which results in frustration and lower user retention.”


2. Research Methods
Chosen Methods

Online Surveys:
To gather feedback about ordering pain points and preferred improvements.

A/B Testing:
To test two homepage versions—one simplified and one detailed—to compare ordering speed and user satisfaction.

Justification

Surveys provide measurable data about user frustrations and needs.
A/B testing reveals which version leads to faster orders and fewer app drop-offs.

3. User Personas
Persona 1: Ananya Rao

Motivation: Wants a one-tap reorder option.



Result

Hence, presenting two different UX project scenarios—a Government Service Portal and a Food Delivery App—is completed successfully with problem statements, research methods, user personas, and suggested image placements.
